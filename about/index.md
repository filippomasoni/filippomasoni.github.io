My name is Filippo Masoni, I'm from Santa Croce sull'Arno (PI), Italy and I'm 25 years old. Well, for now I am, I was born in 1991, so if I don't update this before next year (I probably will), you can keep track on your own.

I started my formation career in Italy quickly falling in love with technology, then I moved to California to continue to College and then came back, because, well Italy is the most beautiful country in the world. But also to make Italy a better place with the use of modern technology. ðŸ˜‰

I currently work as a freelance web developer. I like to make blazing fast, modern websites. I like to travel, take photographs and make films.

I'm always on the look for small projects to takle, so if you have something on your mind, shoot me an email:     f.masoni@Â­gmail.com
